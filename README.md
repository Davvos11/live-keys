# Live Keys

Plugin host (LV2 and VST3) focussed on playing keyboard live.

## Dev dependencies

```shell
sudo apt install liblilv-dev lv2-dev libsuil-dev
```

- `liblilv-dev`/`lv2-dev`: LV2 plugin hosting (`livi`/`lilv`).
- `libsuil-dev`: hosting LV2 plugins' own native GUIs (X11UI embedding via `suil`).

VST3 hosting needs no extra system packages.
